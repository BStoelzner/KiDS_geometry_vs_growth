#KiDS-1000: Geometry versus growth

This repository contains chains and code used in arXiv:XXXX.YYYYY.

### Contents
- **analysis:** Scripts that reproduce the plots in the paper 
- **chains:** Raw MontePython chains
- **montepython_2cosmos_public:** Copy of [MontePython 2cosmos](https://github.com/fkoehlin/montepython_2cosmos_public), a modification of [MontePython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public) that allows the user to write likelihood modules that can request two independent instances of CLASS and separate dictionaries and structures for all cosmological and nuisance parameters. Contains likelihood modules for KiDS-1000, BOSS, eBOSS, and CMB, as described in Section 4 of the paper.
