1. The official eBOSS DR16 scans that were used for the cosmology paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08991) can be found here: 
https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/eboss/DR16cosmo/tags/v1_0_0/likelihoods/

The Lyman-alpha BAO scans are:
sdss_DR16_LYAUTO_BAO_DMDHgrid.txt
sdss_DR16_LYxQSO_BAO_DMDHgrid.txt

This is the README for those files:
The DR16 Lyman-alpha BAO likelihoods are provided separately for the auto (LYAUTO) and cross correlation (LYXQSO). 
They can be treated as independent. The format for each is:

Column 1:  (DM/rd) at z=2.334
Column 2:  (DH/rd) at z=2.334
Column 3:  likelihood (relative to the best point on the grid)

2. Files containing the full scan output in text format with all parameters can be found here: 
https://github.com/igmhub/picca/tree/master/data/duMasdesBourbouxetal2020. 
There is a folder with auto results (auto_full_stdFit), one for the cross (cross_full_stdFit) and one for the combined
results (combined_stdFit). These were used for the Lyman-alpha BAO analysis (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08995.pdf).

3. Attached is a script (get_scan.py) that reads picca fitter2 .h5 output files
(you can find the raw outputs here as auto_scan.h5 and cross_scan.h5) and writes the scan information to a file. 
This script can be used to produce the scan files used by CosmoMC, MontePython and Cobaya, or for getting the scan information
for plotting purposes (see tutorial here https://github.com/igmhub/picca/tree/master/data for more info on plotting contours).

The BAO scans here have been produced with this script. They are:
sdss_DR16_LYAUTO_bao_chi2.dat
sdss_DR16_LYAUTO_bao_likelihood.dat
sdss_DR16_LYxQSO_bao_chi2.dat
sdss_DR16_LYxQSO_bao_likelihood.dat
There are scans with the last column as the chi2 or likelihood for both the Lya auto and cross.
These files can be used with the already existing code in CosmoMC, MontePython and Cobaya.
If you take them from here make sure you check if the chi2 or the likelihood version is needed for the library you plan to use.
Also note the order of the BAO parameters: here we use alpha_transverse, alpha_parallel, but in some cases older scans used the reverse order.

The format of these output files is:

Column 1:  alpha_transverse at z=2.334
Column 2:  alpha_parallel at z=2.334
Column 3:  likelihood or chi2 (you can choose either by adding the word "chi2" or "lik" when calling the script)

Note that if you ask for the likelihood, the values will be relative to the best point in the grid.
The likelihood is simply computed by: lik = exp(-0.5 * chi2)

The alpha parameters are defined as:
alpha_transverse = (DM/rd) / (DM/rd)_fiducial
alpha_parallel = (DH/rd) / (DH/rd)_fiducial

The fiducial values used to compute the alphas are:
(DM/rd)_fiducial = 39.2035
(DH/rd)_fiducial = 8.6011

See Table 2 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08995.pdf for more information on the fiducial values used.
For the bestfit chi2 values see https://github.com/igmhub/picca/tree/master/data/duMasdesBourbouxetal2020 or https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08995.pdf.
